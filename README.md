# status-script
This script is a status line generator. It works as a replacement for i3status, and can be used as-is for swaybar and i3bar. There's also a version for [dwlb](https://github.com/kolunmi/dwlb). To customize it, just edit the script itself, you'll find that this is rather easy.

Required programs:
- bash or a similar shell (duh)
- sleep
- cat
- cut
- grep
- awk
- head
- pactl (from pulseaudio)
- free
- uptime
- iwctl (from iwd)
- date

However, most of these programs can be replaced by their counterparts by editing the script, if you wish to do so.
